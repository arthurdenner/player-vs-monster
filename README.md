# player-vs-monster

This project was build to demonstrate how to get started with ReactJS.

I believe it contains a lot of the basics: state, props, updating parent's state through children components, outputting arrays and interacting with events.

## Branches

This project contains three branches:

- [master](https://github.com/arthurdenner/player-vs-monster): Uses a single HTML file to create the whole game, a truly "getting started";
- [using-create-react-app](https://github.com/arthurdenner/player-vs-monster/tree/using-create-react-app): Uses the [create-react-app CLI](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to build the game using ES modules. A lot more organized and a little more advanced;
- [improving-code](https://github.com/arthurdenner/player-vs-monster/tree/improving-code): Besides using the create-react-app CLI, it uses functional/stateless components and the prop-types package.
